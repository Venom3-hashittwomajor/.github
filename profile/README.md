The kickoff to November used to be a bit of a banger. At the very least, it was a transition from the general downswing into autumn from summer and then back into a full push of holiday cheer. Marvel’s opening of Eternals notwithstanding, the period from 2019 on — albeit one damaged by a pandemic — has been marked more with disappointment and even indifference than anything else by the studios. This year is no exception.

In 2019, the top film at the box office at the usual start of the holiday movie season was Terminator: Dark Fate. It began with a disappointing $29 million and finished with an even more disappointing $62.6 million. In 2020, films dribbled out during the pandemic. November of 2021 began with Eternals and its $71.2 million, but it was ultimately another disappointment for fans, critics, and Disney. Hollywood did not even try in 2022, seemingly believing that Black Adam might still be a thing in its third week. Sure, it won the week with $18.2 million, but its only competition was Crunchyroll’s One Piece Film: Red, which made about half that. Last year, studios left the weekend to the second frame of Five Nights at Freddy’s, which fell over 76%, besting Taylor Swift by a bit over $5 million in its fourth weekend. The new films that week included an inspirational Eugenio Derbez film (Radical), Meg Ryan’s directorial debut (What Happens Later), and Daisy Ridley on the run (The Marsh King’s Daughter). None of those opened in 1,500 theaters.

Perhaps the best news for this week’s No. 1, Venom: The Last Dance, is that its $26.1 million is the highest opening week of November in three years since Eternals (not that it’s going to gross as much domestically as that film, even as it will give it a go worldwide). That is a similar number to what David Fincher’s Gone Girl made in its second weekend ($26.4 million). Venom’s 10-day total is now at $90 million, whereas Gone Girl’s was at $77.8 million. The weekend estimate was initially forecast as around $19-20 million, so that leap is good news for Sony, which hopes to put a little more gravy into this pot. Even if Venom begins to drop a bit more than Fincher’s film, the balance with its lead could still get the film into the $160-170 million domestic range. Globally the film is over $317 million and is already into profit for Sony. It only needs $371 million to enter the top 10 worldwide grossers of the year.
